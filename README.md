Implementation Details: Static Website Deployment on AWS S3 using Terraform

Overview

This Terraform configuration file (main.tf) provisions and configures the necessary AWS resources for hosting a static website on Amazon S3. The implementation includes creating an S3 bucket, configuring static website hosting, uploading website files, setting up access controls, and defining error documents.

Terraform Resources

1. S3 Bucket Creation
The aws_s3_bucket resource named "my-bucket" creates an S3 bucket with the specified name provided as a variable (var.bucketname).
2. S3 Bucket Ownership Controls
The aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls resource ensures that the bucket ownership is set to "BucketOwnerPreferred".
3. S3 Bucket Public Access Block
The aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block resource configures public access settings for the S3 bucket, allowing public read access to objects.
4. S3 Bucket ACL
The aws_s3_bucket_acl resource sets the access control list (ACL) of the S3 bucket to "public-read", enabling public read access to objects.
5. Upload Website Files
Two aws_s3_object resources upload the index.html and error.html files to the S3 bucket. These files represent the main page and error page of the static website, respectively.
6. S3 Bucket Website Configuration
The aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration resource configures the S3 bucket for static website hosting.
It specifies the index.html file as the index document.
It defines the error.html file as the error document to display in case of errors.
7. Dependencies
The resource dependencies ensure that the ACL configuration is applied before setting up the website configuration.
Conclusion

By utilizing Terraform to define infrastructure as code, this implementation automates the provisioning and configuration of AWS resources required for hosting a static website on S3. The defined resources ensure proper access controls, error handling, and website configuration, enabling a seamless deployment process.
